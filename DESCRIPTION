Description: microRNAs are 19-22 nucleotide long molecules responsible for repressing 
    the expression of genes. Several algorithms have been proposed to predict target 
    genes of microRNAs such as targetscan etc. These methods use the fact that a 
    seed sequence of the microRNA is complementary to a part of the sequence in the
    target gene, mostly in the 3' UTR. Free energy of the binding of the microRNA 
    can be used as well as sequence conservation at the target site to improve the 
    predictions. Nevertheless, a current problem is that the false positive rate of
    these predictions is extremely high. This can have several reasons, for example
    the microRNA and the target gene may not be expressed at the same time in a 
    specific cell type or tissue. There is no standard to compare these tools as
    sequence based tools don't use condition specific imformation and hence, result
    in a lot of false positives. There are some expression based tools which use the
    correlation/coefficient information from Although we can't say which tool has the
    best overall performance for all tissue types, we can benchmark these tools ,using
    the regression models on gene and miRNA expression data, for a specific condition.
    R users can use this package to perform regression on their gene and miRNA expression
    data and benchmark different sequence based tools.
